This project explores U.S. airline delay data to uncover insights into the factors driving flight delays across major carriers, airports, and time periods. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that enables users to:

- Identify top delay-causing airlines and airports  
- Understand seasonal and hourly trends in delays  
- Compare carrier performance on arrival and departure punctuality  
- Gain actionable insights for operational improvements and customer experience

The dashboard empowers aviation stakeholders, analysts, and travelers to visually explore and understand airline performance trends in an intuitive, data-driven way.
